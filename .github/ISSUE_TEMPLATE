It can sometimes be confusing to figure out where the best place is to
file an issue or ask a question about a web platform API. Before
reporting an issue here please ask yourself these questions:

1. Are you reporting a bug in the WebUSB implementation in a particular
   browser? If so then please use their issue tracker. For example, the
   Chromium issue tracker is at https://crbug.com.

2. Do you have a question about how to use the WebUSB API? Please
   consider asking on StackOverflow and tag it with "webusb". Questions
   asked on StackOverflow are better indexed by search engines and so
   the answers will help other developers. Questions asked here will be
   answered and the issue closed which makes them much more difficult
   for others to find.

3. Have you found a problem with the way this API is specified or have
   a feature request? File it here.
